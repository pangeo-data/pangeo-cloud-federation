You will download and install the data sets that you will need to run the exercises. There is no point in downloading the same data over and over again, which is why we will do this once as part of this notebook. Once the data is installed you can move on to the next notebook. All three exercises in Homework 1 will use the same data set for the simulations."

So click on \"_File --> Save Notebook As..._\" and save this notebook as `work/homework_1/homework_1_C_setup.ipynb` before you continue.
