    "Now that you know how to access the virtual machine and have gone through some Jupyter and python tutorials, let's move to the real topic of this course, which is snow hydrology and snow modeling. In this first homework you will do a number of exercises using SUMMA as your hydrology model. You will interact with SUMMA using a python module called pySUMMA and you will download the data you need to run the exercises from HydroShare. All the software that you will need to run the exercises is pre-installed in this virtual machine.\n",

    "Homework 1 consists of a series of notebooks for you to work through:\n",

    "* `homework_1_A_introduction.ipynb` : a brief introduction to SUMMA, pySUMMA, and how to download from and upload to HydroShare (this notebook). \n",
