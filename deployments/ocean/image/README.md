# ocean.pangeo.io

Welcome to ocean.pangeo.io, a cloud based JupyterHub operated by the [Pangeo project](http://pangeo.io). This hub is supported by an award from the NSF EarthCube program and by Google Cloud, who contributed credits via NSF's [BIGDATA program](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=244450).

## Getting Help

- Mailing list: general questions about this resource or Pangeo
- Gitter: live chat with other users of the cluster
- Github: report bugs and other technical problems with the cluster. (Note: for questions and bug reports related to specific python packages like xarray, your should go directly to that package's github repository.)
